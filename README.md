## üìñ About This Repository

This project is designed to be a self-contained, open-source bootcamp for anyone looking to learn data science. The curriculum is structured logically, ensuring a smooth learning curve. Each module builds upon the last, with a focus on both theory and practical application.

**Who is this for?**
* Aspiring Data Scientists with little to no programming experience.
* Students looking for a structured data science curriculum.
* Anyone who wants to build a portfolio of hands-on data science projects.

## üó∫Ô∏è The Learning Roadmap

The course is divided into modules, each contained within its own numbered folder.

### **Module 0: Setup and Introduction**
* `00_Setup_and_Introduction/`
    * **Goal:** Set up your complete Python environment and get a high-level overview of the data science lifecycle.

### **Module 1: Python and Math Foundations**
* `01_Python_and_Math_Foundations/`
    * **Goal:** Learn the essential Python syntax, data structures, and the basic concepts of Linear Algebra and Statistics that form the bedrock of data science.

### **Module 2: Data Analysis and Wrangling**
* `02_Data_Analysis_and_Wrangling/`
    * **Goal:** Master the core data analysis libraries, NumPy and Pandas. Learn how to load, clean, and manipulate real-world datasets.

### **Module 3: Data Visualization**
* `03_Data_Visualization/`
    * **Goal:** Learn to create insightful and beautiful charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore data and communicate findings.

### **Module 4: Machine Learning Fundamentals**
* `04_Machine_Learning_Fundamentals/`
    * **Goal:** Dive into predictive modeling with Scikit-Learn. Understand and implement fundamental algorithms for both regression and classification.

### **Module 5: Advanced Topics**
* `05_Advanced_Topics/`
    * **Goal:** Explore specialized areas like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Time Series Forecasting.

### **Module 6: Portfolio Projects**
* `06_Portfolio_Projects/`
    * **Goal:** Apply all your learned skills to build two end-to-end projects: Customer Churn Prediction and a Movie Recommender System.
