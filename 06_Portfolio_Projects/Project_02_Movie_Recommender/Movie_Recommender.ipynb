    "# Portfolio Project 2: Movie Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your second portfolio project! We will build a simple **Movie Recommender System**. Recommender systems are one of the most popular applications of data science and are used by companies like Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube to personalize user experiences. 🎬\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem:** A movie streaming service wants to increase user engagement. They believe that if they can recommend movies that a user is likely to enjoy, the user will spend more time on the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Goal:** Build a recommender system that suggests movies to a user based on the ratings of other, similar users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology: Collaborative Filtering**\n",
    "We will use a technique called **item-based collaborative filtering**. The core idea is simple:\n",
    "> \"Users who liked this item also liked...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The process involves:\n",
    "1.  Finding the correlation between the ratings of every movie.\n",
    "2.  For a given movie, finding the movies with the highest correlation.\n",
    "3.  Returning those highly correlated movies as recommendations."
