    "# Module 3.2: Statistical Plotting with Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "While Matplotlib is the foundation of plotting in Python, **Seaborn** is a specialized library built on top of it. Its primary goal is to make creating sophisticated, attractive, and informative statistical plots much easier. ðŸŽ¨\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use Seaborn?**\n",
    "* **Less Code:** Create complex plots (like boxplots or heatmaps) in a single line of code.\n",
    "* **Beautiful Defaults:** Seaborn plots have a much more modern and aesthetically pleasing default style.\n",
    "* **Pandas Integration:** It works seamlessly with Pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal of this Notebook:**\n",
    "We will learn to create some of the most common statistical plots using Seaborn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Distribution Plots (to see how data is spread)\n",
    "2.  Categorical Plots (to compare across groups)\n",
    "3.  Relational Plots (to see relationships between variables)"
