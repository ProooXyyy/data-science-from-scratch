    "**Scikit-Learn (`sklearn`)** is the gold standard for traditional machine learning in Python. It provides a massive library of well-documented algorithms and a simple, consistent API (Application Programming Interface) for using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal of this Notebook:**\n",
    "Before we dive into specific algorithms, we must understand the fundamental Scikit-Learn workflow. We will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The difference between **Features** (input) and **Target** (output).\n",
    "2.  The crucial concept of the **Train-Test Split**.\n",
    "3.  The standard Scikit-Learn API pattern: `fit()`, `predict()`, and `score()`."

    "* **Features (X):** These are the input variablesâ€”the data we use to make a prediction. This is typically a 2D array or DataFrame.\n",
