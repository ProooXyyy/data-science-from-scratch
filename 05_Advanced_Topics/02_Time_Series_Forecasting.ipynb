    "# Module 5.2: Time Series Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've dealt with data where the order of rows doesn't matter. But what if the data is a sequence of observations recorded over time? This could be daily stock prices, monthly sales figures, or hourly temperature readings. This is **Time Series Data**. üìà\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Series Forecasting** is the process of analyzing this historical data to identify meaningful patterns and using those patterns to predict future values. It's a critical field used in finance, weather forecasting, supply chain management, and many other industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal of this Notebook:**\n",
    "We will go deep into the theory and practical application of analyzing time series data. We will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The Anatomy of a Time Series:** Understanding its core components (Trend, Seasonality, Residuals).\n",
    "2.  **The Importance of the Datetime Index:** How to properly structure time series data in Pandas.\n",
    "3.  **Time Series Decomposition:** A powerful technique to visually separate the components of our data."

    "\n",
    "A time series can be broken down into three fundamental components. Understanding these is the key to effective forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Trend:** The long-term direction of the data. Is it generally increasing, decreasing, or staying flat over time? For example, the total number of internet users globally has a clear upward trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Seasonality:** A repeating, fixed, and periodic pattern in the data. For example, ice cream sales are consistently higher in the summer months and lower in the winter. This pattern repeats every year.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Residuals (or Noise):** The random, irregular fluctuations in the data that are not explained by the trend or seasonality. This is the unpredictable component.\n",
