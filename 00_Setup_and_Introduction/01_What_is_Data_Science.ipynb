    "**Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a data scientist as a modern-day detective. They sift through clues (data) to solve a mystery (a business problem) and present the solution (insights) to help make better decisions.\n",

    "* **Computer Science & Programming:** To collect, process, and manage the data.\n",
    "* **Math & Statistics:** To analyze the data, find patterns, and build reliable models.\n",
    "* **Domain/Business Knowledge:** To ask the right questions and understand the real-world context of the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Business Understanding & Problem Framing:** What problem are we trying to solve? What data do we need?\n",
    "2.  **Data Collection:** Gathering data from databases, APIs, web scraping, etc.\n",
    "3.  **Data Cleaning & Preparation (Wrangling):** This is often the most time-consuming step. It involves handling missing values, correcting errors, and formatting data.\n",
    "4.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploring the data to find initial patterns, trends, and relationships using statistics and visualizations.\n",
    "5.  **Modeling:** Selecting and building a machine learning model to make predictions or classify outcomes.\n",
    "6.  **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance to see if it solves the business problem effectively.\n",
    "7.  **Deployment & Communication:** Presenting the findings to stakeholders (e.g., via a report or dashboard) and/or deploying the model into a live application."

    "* **Answer complex questions** using data.\n",
    "* **Identify trends and patterns** that are not immediately obvious.\n",
    "* **Build predictive models** to forecast future events (e.g., customer churn, sales, stock prices).\n",
